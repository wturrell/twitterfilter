# Twitterfilter Bookmarklet

Removes tweets by people you *don't* follow from your timeline / mentions — potentially useful if you're getting a lot of unwanted messages.As you'll see from the code, it's very passive and will not tweet or do anything else on your behalf — nor is there anything tracked or recorded.

The [project homepage](http://wturrell.co.uk/twitterfilter.html) has a link to a preinstalled version — it needs to be https:// hosted — which you can add simply by dragging to your bookmarks.
