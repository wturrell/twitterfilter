# Twitterfilter Bookmarklet

Removes tweets by people you *don't* follow from your timeline / mentions — potentially useful if you're getting a lot of unwanted messages.

[http://wturrell.co.uk/twitterfilter.js](Project homepage) (has a preinstalled version of bookmarklet — it needs to be https:// hosted — which you can install simply by dragging).
